# Dataset Guidelines

- Collect **2–5 MB** of cleaned, deduplicated charter text (wards, services, fees, docs, SLAs).  
- Create **≥600** instruction–answer pairs; at least **40% Nepali**.  
- Split **by document** (80/10/10) to avoid leakage.  
- Provide `DATA_SOURCES.md` with URLs/titles and licenses.
